The goal of this project is to segment
customers based on their purchasing
behaviour and demographic information.
We will use unsupervised learning
techniques to identify groups of customers
with similar behaviour and
characteristics. This information can be
used to develop targeted marketing
campaigns, personalize product
recommendations, and optimize pricing
strategies.
